This script is derived from the one available at: https://github.com/lexo-ch/fsarchiver-encrypted-full-system-backup-script-with-email-monitoring which I thanks. 
I modified it to cover my needs for performing backups/restores of my systems and those of my friends. I especially appreciated fsarchiver's ability to perform restores even on smaller devices which has no other freely available software has.
Even I am not so good at  bash scripts I by hook or by crook written all the necessary lines to make it working.
If any other may make it better I appreciate.
