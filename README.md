Description

This script is derived from the two's available at: https://github.com/lexo-ch/fsarchiver-encrypted-full-system-backup-script-with-email-monitoring and https://github.com/AndresDev859674/boot-repair which I thanks. 
I kept some parts from them to cover my needs in: performing complete backups/restores and boot repair of my systems and those of my friends.
Since I use Manjaro as my preferred OS which is derived from ArchLinux, I am not able to run qt-fsarchiver because it is available only for other distributions.
What I appreciate of fsarchiver is the ability to perform restores even on smaller devices which no other freely available software has.
Even I am not so good at bash scripts I by hook or by crook written all the necessary lines to have a usable program to perform backup, restore and grub repair.
If any other that may do it better I'll appreciate.
