This script is derived from the one available at: https://github.com/lexo-ch/fsarchiver-encrypted-full-system-backup-script-with-email-monitoring and https://github.com/AndresDev859674/boot-repair which I thanks. 
I kept most of parts from the two's to cover my needs in: performing complete backups/restores of my systems and those of my friends.
Since I use Manjaro as my preferred OS which is derived from Arch, I wouldn't able to run qt-fsarchiver even I was able to test on other distributions.
What I appreciate of fsarchiver is the ability to perform restores even on smaller devices which no other freely available software has.
Even I am not so good at bash scripts I by hook or by crook written all the necessary lines to have a usable program to perform backups, restores and grub repair.
If any other that may make it better I appreciate their suggestions.
